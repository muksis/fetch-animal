# Random animal facts

## Description

This project fetches random animals' facts and pics from [here](https://zoo-animal-api.herokuapp.com). New animal is shown on every refresh or with a click on the New Animal button. I used useState and useEffect hooks in this project.

## Roadmap of future improvements

Add a button to get new animal's info on every click. Done ✅ \
Add useEffect with localStorage so that a new animal is fetched only when the button is pressed.\
Work on css.
